## About

This repository retains the municipal source clients and configuration for NIPKaart. The direct SQL importer, database credentials, cron, Docker runtime and deployment stacks have been removed. This change does not install their replacement or activate any production job.

The next importer is tracked in [#774](https://github.com/NIPKaart/disabled-parking/issues/774): one accepted source through its universal package, a small mapping and one file for core. Automatic delivery later uses a private bucket; see [the cross-repository epic](https://github.com/NIPKaart/core/issues/1176). Existing source-fetch methods are retained as reusable source knowledge, not proof of complete live data.

## Development

Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Python 3.11+:

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked pre-commit install
uv run --locked pre-commit run --all-files
```

The `cities` and `dev` groups are installed by default. `.env.example` contains only source endpoint settings for the direct-source helpers. No database connection is opened when importing the municipality classes. Source/parser behavior remains owned by the universal packages.
